Learning R for survey experiments
# 📊 R Learning Journey — Survey Experiment Mastery

Welcome to my repository documenting a complete, from-zero-to-pro journey in mastering **R** for social science and **survey experiment research**.  
This project is designed to build every essential skill required to design, run, analyse, and report survey experiments — from data wrangling to causal inference — using professional, reproducible workflows.

## 🧭 Project Overview

This repository will gradually evolve as I progress through an intensive, multi-phase learning plan covering:

1. 🧱 **Fundamentals** — Core R syntax, data types, structures, operators  
2. 🧼 **Data Wrangling** — Cleaning, transforming, reshaping, merging  
3. 📊 **Visualisation** — Building high-quality graphs with `ggplot2`  
4. 🎲 **Experiment Design** — Randomisation, assignment, reproducibility  
5. 📈 **Power Analysis** — Analytical and simulation-based approaches  
6. 📉 **Statistical Analysis** — Regression, ANOVA, factorial designs  
7. 🧪 **Advanced Methods** — Weighting, imputation, reliability analysis  
8. 🧾 **Reporting** — Quarto reports, reproducible pipelines, GitHub workflow

By the end, this repository will serve as a **complete working pipeline** for a dissertation-level survey experiment project.
